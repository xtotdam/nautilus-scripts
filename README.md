# nautilus-scripts

Some quite useful scripts for some routinous work

`git clone https://github.com/xtotdam/nautilus-scripts.git ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts`


### Notes

* some of them require `notify-send` to work
* `Parallel linkfile downloader.py` is from https://github.com/xtotdam/concurrent-downloader and may be a bit outdated.

### Troubleshooting

In case something doesn't work, you may need to install some of these packages

```
ddjvu
id3ren
imagemagick
meld
pdf2djvu
xclip
zenity

pdfnup	(from texlive)
pdfcrop	(from texlive)
```

or python packages

```
eventlet
PIL
```

### TODO
* [ ] Make me choose prefix for `Add directory prefix.py`
* [x] GUI for `PDF to WxH.sh`
